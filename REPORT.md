### Stack

- React: I chose react for the challenge because it is my favorite and I have been using it for about two years and I absolutely love it.

- Typescript: I use typescript pretty much in all of my projects, even though I think it only makes a difference when used on bigger projects but i got so used to it that I now used everywhere.

- faker: since I did not find any data attached to challenge I used faker to generate fake emails

- styled-components: it is my favorite styling method for react, it makes it easy to create highly customizable components

- react-daterange-picker: a customizable data range picker components that works across all modern browsers, I choose this one because it's highly customizable and I was able to easily tweak it so that it looks like the one in the result.pdf

### Overall

it was a fun project to work on, I just wish it was possible for me to reach out and ask questions about it. Anyway I tried to solve it to the best of my understanding, hopefully I did Okay.
